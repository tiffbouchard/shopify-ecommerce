## Next Steps
- Connect Sanity and Shopify to sync product data with webhooks in order to provide seamless management of products for client (not sure how to do this, but will find out)
- Create a function to see if an item is already in the cart, if so disable button and show message saying the item is already in your cart (since there is only a quantity of one per product)
- Add ability to view how many things are in the cart for better UX (right now just have a toast everytime a visitor adds an item to their cart)
- ~~Search page~~ (Sept 3, 2020)
- ~~Add ability to click outside of the dropdown to trigger dropdown close for better UX~~ (February 9th, 2020 -> opted for hover) 
- ~~Newsletter with Mailchimp~~
- ~~Contact + custom orders form with EmailJS~~ (No custom orders yet)
- Reorganize CSS (possibly transfer to styled components?) + understand better project structure for Next.js + organization
- Remove all hardcoded info and transfer to Sanity CMS to allow client flexibility of updating content (Policy and About pages)
- ~~Ability to display multiple photos of details page in a carousel~~ (Sept 24, 2020)
